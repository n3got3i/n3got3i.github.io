	<h1>Lucian and Lucia</h1>
    <h2>The Manor House Hotel</h2>
	    <p>Once upon a time there was this mother fucker romanian guy that was sick of life and people in Romania and he decided to move to <a href="file:///C:/Users/negot_000/Desktop/master%20project/pads/web%201.html" target="_blank"><em>(1)Ingla Tierra</em></a>. That is a longer story for later; for now we will keep to Lucian and Lucia.<br><br> Lucia was a spanish girl from Tenerife that loved her country and her people but she needed to learn a little more english to help her get a job as a teacher back home...So what better way to do that than go to England and learn english from a romanian guy. Funny, yeah, I know, everybody knows you need to stay away from romanian immigrants because gypsies and all that..<br><br>So long story short, the universe decided that we both end up working in the same place. I don't know why she took an interest in me but I surely do know that when I first saw her I thought I want to sleep on her behind :)). I won't go into to much detail on that either because i'm just trying to learn how to make a website at the moment

<h2>Gidleigh Park Hotel and more...</h2>
<p>After The Manor House, we decided to finally say " Fuck you " and we left. We went to the south, in the middle of nowhere, a place called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagford" target="_blank"> <strong>Chagford</strong></a> that was in the middle of the <a href="http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Dartmoor National Park</strong></a>.It was beautiful, nature, nature and nature again, amazing. in the middle of nowhere, single track roads, wild animals and amazing views...BUT if you want a bottle of water after 4 or 5 in the evening you need to get in the car and drive 40 minutes to <a href="https://www.visitexeter.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Exeter</strong></a> on a combination of single track roads and motorways. That's just fucked up.. so we couldn't do that for too long and we decided to move back in the center of the <a href="file:///C:/Users/negot_000/Desktop/master%20project/pads/web%201.html" target="_blank"><em>2 amazing England</em></a>, so we reached to our previous company and went to work in a different venue of theirs, somewhere on top of a hill. <br><br>The place was up for sale for a long time and nobody wanted to buy it because it was really shit, so they decided to bring a restaurant manager and make him a general manager and give him a shit team and at least make some money there while they wait for the place to be sold. You have no idea... :))) that place was sooo bad.. so bad . we were sleeping basically in the addic of the hotel and every 2 days we had to get out because the fire alarm test was done by an overly preparing restaurant manager. We gave up going out eventually because we were curious how long they will keep the fire alarm on before they realised we won't come down. Soo.. we got that problem fixed. After a week or 2 I was promoted to bar manager and this made the pseudo gay romanian bartender that was there before me very very mad and he was in a constant PMS mood which made thing really annoying:)).<br><br> AAaaaany way, long story short we left that shit as well and we moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheltenham" target="_blank"><strong>Cheltenham</strong></a>. We spent a couple of months together here, and then Lucia went to Tenerife to finally be a teacher because now she was a professional english speaker. It was hard without her there but what can you do. after she left I found a job in a village 40 min away and I slowly but steadily got promoted more and more. Then I ended up moving closer to work and then I ended up going back to Romania for a couple of months, then moved to Gran Canaria with Lucia and asked her to marry me. Retarded as she is, she actually said yes.. hahahaha.<br><br>Anyway, I am happy now. I just need to find a fucking job already.. geezus. Wanna see some photos and videos ? Me too
